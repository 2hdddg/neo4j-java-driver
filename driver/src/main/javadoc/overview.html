This is the reference driver implementation for <a href="http://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a> 3.0, it allows you to connect to a
Neo4j server and interact with it.
If you are using Java, this is generally the interface you'd use to integrate Neo4j in your application.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To include this driver in your application, you need to include it on your classpath.
    The driver is available as a maven artifact, and can be included in regular Maven projects as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.neo4j.driver&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;neo4j-java-driver&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Getting Connected</h3>

<p>Once you have the driver and a connector on your classpath, you can establish sessions with Neo4j.</p>

Have a look at the <a href="org/neo4j/driver/GraphDatabase.html" title="interface in org.neo4j"><code>GraphDatabase</code></a> class to get started.
